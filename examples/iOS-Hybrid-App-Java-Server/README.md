# JAVA Server Demo for a Client app

This is a JAVA Server Demo which exposes endpoints that will be consumed by a Client app.  

The endpoints trigger functionality from the GP JAVA SDK.

The JAVA Server is done using [Spring Boot](https://github.com/globalpayments/java-sdk/tree/master/src/test/java/com/global/api/tests) which creates a Tomcat server on port: 8080 by default.
