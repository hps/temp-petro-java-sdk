## Installation

Installing the SDK into your solution is usually be done by using Maven.

To install via [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html):

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.heartlandpaymentsystems</groupId>
  <artifactId>globalpayments-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Documentation and Examples

You can find the latest SDK documentation along with code examples and test cards on the [Global Payments](https://developer.realexpayments.com) and [Heartland](https://developer.heartlandpaymentsystems.com/documentation) Developer Hubs.

In addition you can find working examples in the our example code repository.

*Quick Tip*: The included [test suite](https://github.com/globalpayments/java-sdk/tree/master/src/test/java/com/global/api/tests) can be a great source of code samples for using the SDK!

#### Process a Payment Example

```java
CreditCardData card = new CreditCardData();
card.setNumber("4111111111111111");
card.setExpMonth("12");
card.setExpYear("2025");
card.setCvn("123");

try
{
    Transaction response = card.authorize(new BigDecimal("129.99"))
        .withCurrency("EUR")
        .execute();

    String result = response.getResponseCode(); // 00 == Success
    String message = response.getResponseMessage(); // [ test system ] AUTHORISED
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    // handle errors
}
```

#### Test Card Data

Name        | Number           | Exp Month | Exp Year | CVN
----------- | ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ----
Visa        | 4263970000005262 | 12        | 2025     | 123
MasterCard  | 2223000010005780 | 12        | 2019     | 900
MasterCard  | 5425230000004415 | 12        | 2025     | 123
Discover    | 6011000000000087 | 12        | 2025     | 123
Amex        | 374101000000608  | 12        | 2025     | 1234
JCB         | 3566000000000000 | 12        | 2025     | 123
Diners Club | 36256000000725   | 12        | 2025     | 123

#### Testing Exceptions

During your integration you will want to test for specific issuer responses such as 'Card Declined'. Because our sandbox environments do not actually reach out to issuing banks for authorizations, there are specific transaction amounts and/or card numbers that will trigger gateway and issuing bank responses. Please contact your support representative for a complete listing of values used to simulate transaction AVS/CVV results, declines, errors, and other responses that can be caught in your code. Example error handling code:

```java
try
{
    Transaction response = card.authorize(new BigDecimal("-5.00"))
        .withCurrency("EUR")
        .withAddress(address)
        .execute();
}
catch (BuilderException e)
{
    // handle builder errors
}
catch (ConfigurationException e)
{
    // handle errors related to your services configuration
}
catch (GatewayException e)
{
    // handle gateway errors/exceptions
}
catch (UnsupportedTransactionException e)
{
    // handle errors when the configured gateway doesn't support
    // desired transaction
}
catch (ApiException e)
{
    // handle all other errors
}
```
